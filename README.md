# Drawing-Shapes
The Shape Drawing Program is a Java graphical application through which users may draw and easily manipulate shapes in geometry by use of a truly simple interface for all users. It uses Java Swing as well as AWT. In addition to that, it draws lines and rectangles, along with ovals, with colors that are able to be changed. Key features include drawing of shapes, interaction by the user, selection of color, and rastering, as well as trails for ogling. The application has capabilities for dynamic file management and shape rendering. It completely adheres to an object-oriented structure, adeptly uses event management, and wisely uses ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream for saving and getting data.
